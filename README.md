Plate Generator for CindyMill

CNC mills are cool machines. CindyMill (http://cindymill.xyz/) is one of those.
This repository proviedes a set of python scripts to draw the needed parts as dxf.
Advantage is that you can easily do adaptions even if you have no access to a full blown CAD system.

It's based on python and the ezdxf module (btw great stuff).
