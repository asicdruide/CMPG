CNC mills are cool machines. CindyMill is one of those.

This repository provides a set of python scripts to draw the needed parts as dxf.
Advantage is that you can easily do adaptions even if you have no access to a full blown CAD system.

It's based on python and the ezdxf module (btw great stuff).

This is work-in-progress, if you use it, you do it on your own risk.

Planned improvements:
 * ~~central setup file for all parameters~~ (done)
 * more dependencies calculated (less magic numbers)
 * output for non-plate values like extrusion length
 * ~~parts library for common parts~~ (done)
